Customer Retention and Revenue Analytics Dashboard
4
Overview

This project is an end to end analytics solution built in Power BI to measure how customer retention connects to revenue performance and operational outcomes. It combines cohort analysis with executive level KPIs so teams can understand not just how much they sell, but how well they keep customers over time.

Business Problem

Many dashboards focus only on revenue. That view hides the real driver of sustainable growth which is retention. This report answers critical questions:

Which customer cohorts are improving
When customers tend to drop off
How retention trends impact revenue and order behavior
Whether operational performance influences loyalty

Dashboard Highlights

Executive KPI Layer
Quick view of Delivered Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, and On Time Delivery Rate to monitor overall health.

Cohort Retention Heatmap
Month by month retention visualization from Month 1 through Month 12 with conditional formatting to instantly spot strong and weak cohorts.

Retention Curve Comparison
Small multiples allow side by side cohort behavior analysis, revealing how different acquisition periods perform over time.

Milestone Retention Metrics
Focused KPIs such as Month 3 and Month 12 retention help track early engagement and long term loyalty.

Trend Analysis
Revenue, orders, and service performance visualized across time to connect operational execution with customer outcomes.

Interactive Exploration
Dynamic slicers enable filtering by cohort and time range so stakeholders can drill into specific performance windows.

Data Approach

Cohort Logic
Customers are grouped by their first purchase month, allowing lifecycle tracking from acquisition onward.

Time Based Analysis
Retention is calculated relative to cohort age in months rather than calendar date, ensuring accurate behavioral comparison.

Data Modeling
Structured relationships support scalable calculations, filtering, and performance optimization.

Key Metrics Calculated

Retention Rate by Cohort Age
Average Retention Across Cohorts
Month 3 Retention as an Early Engagement Signal
Month 12 Retention as a Loyalty Indicator
Revenue and Order Trends Linked to Retention Behavior
Operational KPI Impact on Customer Continuity

Tools and Techniques

Power BI for modeling and visualization
DAX for cohort calculations, filter context handling, and time intelligence
Data modeling to structure cohort driven analysis
Python used to generate and validate analytical datasets
Dashboard design focused on clarity and decision support

Why This Project Matters

Retention analysis shows whether growth is durable or temporary. By combining behavioral cohorts with financial and operational metrics, this dashboard helps organizations:

Detect churn patterns early
Measure quality of customer acquisition
Align logistics performance with customer satisfaction
Make decisions that improve lifetime value rather than short term sales

Use Cases

Product and growth teams evaluating customer stickiness
Operations teams understanding service impact on loyalty
Leadership tracking sustainable revenue performance
Analysts exploring lifecycle behavior instead of static reporting
